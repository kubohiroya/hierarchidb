# TurboWarp Plus Editor Git proxy

This optional contract implements mode B of [TurboWarp Plus Editor #315](https://github.com/kubohiroya/turbowarp-plus-editor/issues/315). It uses GitHub App web authorization, a BFF-owned Durable Object, and a Git-only route in the CORS Worker.

Account-scoped initial creation uses the separate [repository creation contract](./github-repository-creation.md).

## Login and session

1. The Editor POSTs JSON `{remote, write, review?}` to the BFF at `/v1/git-auth/start`. `review` is an optional boolean that requests the grant to submit pull request reviews; it is separate from `write` (push) and is false when omitted. A non-boolean value returns `400 BAD_REQUEST`. The BFF returns an authorization URL and an opaque login ticket. The Editor keeps the ticket in memory and opens the authorization URL.
2. GitHub calls `/v1/git-auth/callback`. The BFF atomically consumes the OAuth state before exchanging the code using PKCE. It validates the selected repository ID and requested permission. The callback returns a plain confirmation.
3. With the login ticket as its Bearer, the Editor polls `GET /v1/git-auth/session` on the BFF. A pending login returns 202. A completed login returns the Cloudflare connection, account, proxy Bearer, and expiration in Unix milliseconds. The ticket is origin-bound and can obtain a renewed five-minute proxy Bearer until the login expires. The login lasts at most eight hours.
4. `DELETE /v1/git-auth/session` with the login ticket revokes the server-side record. In-flight calls recheck the record before authorization completes.

Initial publication may add `repositoryId` (a positive safe integer) to the start body. The callback requests that ID in the [GitHub token exchange](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app) and checks it against the ID returned by the repository lookup before granting the session. The session response echoes the verified ID only for this opt-in flow. Git authorization checks that ID again for every request, including discovery redirects.

GitHub access and refresh tokens and the current proxy secret are encrypted with AES-GCM in the BFF's Durable Object. The BFF serializes token rotation. The Git Worker accesses authorization through a Durable Object binding. The public BFF endpoints return display information and the proxy session, keeping upstream credentials in the Worker boundary.

## Proxy

The Git-only routes are `GET /v1/git/<owner>/<repo>.git/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack|git-receive-pack` and `POST /v1/git/<owner>/<repo>.git/git-upload-pack|git-receive-pack`. The proxy verifies the exact HTTPS origin of its own deployment, the request origin, the Bearer, the repository ID, and the operation. The allowed caller origins are explicit. To enable Desktop, add `tw-editor://.` to both origin lists. An allowed OPTIONS returns 204 with the requested method and permitted headers. Authenticated Git responses and errors include the exact allowed origin and are marked `no-store`.

The proxy creates a new GitHub HTTP Basic authorization header, preserves Smart HTTP binary streams, and checks the declared POST length against the 32 MiB limit. It validates at most one discovery redirect to the same GitHub repository ID and service, and refuses RPC redirects. Error bodies use `{code, requestId}`.

The `git-receive-pack` POST requires a lowercase UUID v4 in `Git-Push-Id`. Its preflight permits the header. The BFF atomically reserves the ID after validating the session, repository and write grant, before the Git Worker sends the POST. It returns `409 PUSH_DUPLICATE` for a reserved ID. The reservation survives request failures, Worker restarts and Bearer renewal, and expires with the login. A login accepts up to 256 distinct IDs and returns `429 RATE_LIMITED` at capacity. The Git Worker requires confirmation of the reservation from the BFF. Deploy both Workers and enable push with a client that implements this contract. [Editor contract](https://github.com/kubohiroya/turbowarp-plus-editor/issues/316)

## GitHub API routes

This section implements stage A of [TurboWarp Plus Editor #444](https://github.com/kubohiroya/turbowarp-plus-editor/issues/444) ([hierarchidb #1757](https://github.com/kubohiroya/hierarchidb/issues/1757)). The Git Worker relays a fixed set of pull request and review calls to GitHub under `/v1/github/<owner>/<repo>/`. Pull request contents stay on Git Smart HTTP. The routes forward no arbitrary URL and no client GraphQL document. They do not relay changed-file lists, file contents or comparisons, line comments, standalone REST comments, or pull request creation, merge and close.

| Route | Upstream | Query or operation | Grant | `GIT_GITHUB_API` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /pulls` | `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?state=all&sort=updated&direction=desc&per_page=20&page=<page>` | `page` 1–50, at most once | read | `pulls-read` |
| `GET /pulls/<n>` | `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}` (`application/vnd.github.text+json`) | none | read | `pulls-read` |
| `GET /pulls/<n>/publication-status` | `POST https://api.github.com/graphql` with the fixed publication status query | none | read | `checks-read` |
| `POST /graphql/<operation>` | `POST https://api.github.com/graphql` with a fixed document | `pullRequestReviewContext` (read); `addPullRequestReview`, `addPullRequestReviewThread`, `submitPullRequestReview`, `deletePullRequestReview` (review) | per operation | `review-threads` |
| `GET /pulls/<n>/reviews` | `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/reviews?per_page=30&page=<page>` | `page` 1–10, at most once | read | `reviews-body` |
| `POST /pulls/<n>/reviews` | `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/reviews` | none | review | `reviews-body` |

`<owner>` and `<repo>` follow the Git routes' rules without the `.git` suffix. `<n>` is 1–2,147,483,647 without leading zeros. Any other method, path, query, repeated query, page or operation returns `400 BAD_REQUEST` before the session or GitHub is contacted. A route group missing from `GIT_GITHUB_API` returns `404 GITHUB_API_UNAVAILABLE`; an unknown or repeated value in the variable fails every route with `500 GITHUB_API_MISCONFIGURED`. The `reviews-body` routes are the fallback that sends a review body alone when `review-threads` is off.

### Validation order

1. Origin: exact match in `GIT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (rejecting `null`, `*` and a missing origin) and the Worker's own `GIT_PROXY_ORIGIN`, as on the Git routes. Errors after this step carry the allowed origin and `Cache-Control: no-store`.
2. `GIT_GITHUB_API` and the route group.
3. Path, method and query. A preflight must request the route's method. GET permits only `authorization`; POST permits `authorization, content-type, review-submit-id`. Other requested headers return `403 FORBIDDEN`.
4. Bearer (`<state>.<secret>`, as on the Git routes): `401 SESSION_REQUIRED`.
5. Request shape. GET has no body and no `Review-Submit-Id`. POST requires `Content-Type: application/json`, a `Content-Length` (`411 LENGTH_REQUIRED`) of at most 256 KiB (`413 PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`), a JSON object body and the variables below. `Review-Submit-Id` (a lowercase UUID v4) is required on `POST /pulls/<n>/reviews` and the four mutations, optional on `pullRequestReviewContext`, and rejected elsewhere.
6. The session in `GitSession` `/authorize` with `operation` (`read` or `review`): origin, expiry, revocation and the repository name. `review` requires the login's `review` grant (`403 FORBIDDEN`).
7. Repository ID: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}` on every request must return the session's repository ID with `permissions.pull` (reads and reviews alike; push is not required). A rate-limited lookup returns `429 RATE_LIMITED` with `retryAfter`; other failures return `403 FORBIDDEN` (`401 REAUTH_REQUIRED` for a rejected token).
8. Reservation (`POST /pulls/<n>/reviews` and GraphQL steps), then the single upstream request.

Upstream requests go only to `https://api.github.com` with the canonical owner and repository name from the lookup. Their headers are `Authorization: Bearer <user access token>`, a fixed `Accept` (`application/vnd.github.text+json` for a single pull request, otherwise `application/vnd.github+json`), `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28` on REST only, `User-Agent`, and `Content-Type: application/json` on POST. The client's Bearer, cookies, `Origin` and `Referer` are not forwarded. Redirects are not followed (`409 REDIRECT_REJECTED`). The upstream timeout is 30 seconds (`504 UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT`).

### Variables

The GraphQL body is a JSON object of variables only; any other key or a value of the wrong type returns `400 BAD_REQUEST`. Clients never send a GraphQL document or a node ID.

| Operation | Variables | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pullRequestReviewContext` | `number` | |
| `addPullRequestReview` | `number`, `commitOid` | `commitOid` is 40 lowercase hex digits |
| `addPullRequestReviewThread` | `number`, `threadIndex`, `path`, `body` | `threadIndex` 0–49; `path` is relative, at most 1,024 UTF-8 bytes, its last element is exactly `project.source.json`, with no empty, `.` or `..` element, `\` or control character; `body` 1–65,536 characters |
| `submitPullRequestReview` | `number`, `threadCount`, `event`, `body` | `threadCount` 0–50; `event` is `COMMENT`, `APPROVE` or `REQUEST_CHANGES`; `body` at most 65,536 characters, non-empty for `REQUEST_CHANGES`, and for `COMMENT` without threads |
| `deletePullRequestReview` | `number` | |

`POST /pulls/<n>/reviews` accepts only `commit_id` (40 lowercase hex digits, required), `event` (`COMMENT`, `APPROVE` or `REQUEST_CHANGES`, required) and `body` (required and non-empty except for `APPROVE`, at most 65,536 characters). `comments` and an empty `event` are rejected.

The Worker keeps the five review documents and the publication status query in `packages/backend/cors-proxy/src/githubReviewDocuments.ts`. The thread mutation writes `subjectType: FILE` into the document. The Worker fills in `owner` and `name` (canonical, `followRenames: false`), `pullRequestId` and `reviewId`.

### Pull request publication status

The status route uses an ordinary repository-bound Git session with the `read` grant. The Worker verifies the GraphQL repository ID against the session grant, the pull request number against the path, and the rollup commit OID against the current head SHA. It rejects a mismatched repository with `403 FORBIDDEN` and a mismatched pull request or rollup SHA with `502 UPSTREAM_FAILURE`. The session lookup and the GraphQL query read GitHub repository data.

The response contains:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `repositoryId`, `number` | Verified GitHub repository ID and pull request number |
| `state`, `mergedAt`, `draft` | `OPEN`, `CLOSED` or `MERGED`; a merge timestamp or `null`; the draft flag |
| `head` | `{ ref, sha, repositoryId }` with `repositoryId: null` when the head repository cannot be identified |
| `base` | `{ ref, sha }` in the verified repository |
| `checks` | `{ state, totalCount }`; state is `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, `PENDING`, `ERROR` or `EXPECTED`, or `null` when no rollup contexts are visible |
| `reviewDecision` | `APPROVED`, `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, `REVIEW_REQUIRED` or `null` |
| `mergeStateStatus`, `mergeable` | GitHub's [detailed merge status and mergeability](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/pulls#mergestatestatus) |

The queue must compare the returned head repository, ref and SHA with its approved publication job and compare the base with the intended target. A successful [check rollup](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/commits#statuscheckrollup) reports the status of visible checks on that head. A zero count gives no CI evidence. GitHub evaluates branch rules, required reviews, test-merge or merge-queue checks, and merge permissions at the point of merge.

For a live read check, enable `checks-read` on the Git Worker, approve the GitHub App installation on a disposable test repository, and authorize the user's normal Git session for that repository. Grant `Contents: Read` for Git read access, `Pull requests: Read`, `Checks: Read` and `Commit statuses: Read` for PR status and both kinds of checks. An existing write grant is sufficient for its corresponding read permission. Have the repository owner prepare a PR with a CI workflow or external check, and poll the route before and after pushing an updated head. Compare the returned SHA and status with GitHub. A different repository, a disallowed origin and an expired session must be rejected. Removing `checks-read` disables the route independently.

### Approval for future publication writes

A future BFF publication endpoint would start from a BFF-hosted confirmation screen that shows the exact repository, branches and commit IDs, PR title and body, issue action, merge method and authorized steps. The Worker would issue a short-lived approval tied to the authenticated account, repository ID, allowed Editor origin and job ID only after the user confirms that preview. The job should reserve its approved steps in durable storage and recover verified outcomes after timeouts. Approval and mutation handling require a separate capability from the status route and the normal Git session.

The server should re-read the pull request, compare its current head and base with the approved job, and pass the expected head SHA in GitHub's merge request. A changed target or head requires renewed approval. For a stacked pull request, the approval must identify the predecessor pull request and intended base. An issue close requires an approved issue action and verified merge. The GitHub App installation would need `Pull requests: Write` for creation, `Contents: Write` for push and [merge](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls#merge-a-pull-request), and `Issues: Write` when creating or explicitly closing an issue. Configure each permission on the installation and verify the user can perform the approved actions under the repository's rules.

### Node IDs

The proxy never accepts a node ID from the client and never returns one. Before `addPullRequestReview`, the Worker sends `pullRequestReviewContext` with the verified repository and uses `pullRequest.id` only when `repository.databaseId` equals the session's repository ID. The review ID comes only from the `addPullRequestReview` response, after its `pullRequest.id`, `state: PENDING` and commit match. `GitSession` stores both in the submit record and passes them to the Worker in the `/authorize` grant of later steps of the same submit ID, session and pull request.

### Review-Submit-Id and steps

One `Review-Submit-Id` represents one review submission. `GitSession` keeps two keys that expire with the login, are removed on revoke and expiry, and survive Worker restarts and Bearer renewal:

- `review-ids`: IDs of `POST /pulls/<n>/reviews`, reserved in the same transaction pattern as `push-ids`. A reserved ID returns `409 REVIEW_DUPLICATE`.
- `review-submits`: GraphQL submit ID → `{repositoryId, number, commitOid, pullRequestNodeId, reviewNodeId, threads, state, since, attempt}`.

The two keys hold at most 256 entries together, including finished ones; beyond that `/authorize` returns `429 RATE_LIMITED` without `retryAfter`, because waiting does not free capacity. An ID is unique across both keys.

`/authorize` checks the step against the record and writes the in-flight state in one transaction before the Worker contacts GitHub. The Worker reports the upstream outcome to the internal `/review-result` route (`ok`, `failed`, `unknown`, `gone`, or for a check `pending`, `submitted`, `closed`) with the record's `attempt` nonce. `GitSession` applies it only while the nonce is current.

| Step | Accepted when | Duplicate (`409 REVIEW_DUPLICATE`) | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `addPullRequestReview` | the ID is new and the session has no unfinished record for the pull request (otherwise `409 REVIEW_STEP_CONFLICT`) | any existing record with the ID | `starting` → `pending` (0 threads), `closed`, or `start-unknown` |
| `addPullRequestReviewThread` | `pending` and `threadIndex` equals the accepted threads | `threadIndex` below the count, or the index of the thread in flight or last failed | `threading` → `pending` (+1), `broken`, or `closed` if the review is gone |
| `submitPullRequestReview` | `pending` and `threadCount` equals the accepted threads | `submitting`, `submit-unknown`, `submitted` | `submitting` → `submitted`, `pending` (not sent), `submit-unknown`, or `closed` if gone |
| `deletePullRequestReview` | `pending` or `broken` | `deleting`, `closed` | `deleting` → `closed`, or back to the previous state |
| `pullRequestReviewContext` with the ID | any record of the same pull request | — | `start-unknown` → `pending` when the viewer's pending review on the recorded commit has an empty body and no comments, else `closed`; `submit-unknown` → `submitted`, `pending` or `closed` by finding the recorded review |

Any other step order, a different repository or pull request number, or a missing record returns `409 REVIEW_STEP_CONFLICT`. An in-flight state older than 60 seconds is read as unknown (`starting` → `start-unknown`, `threading` → `broken`, `submitting` → `submit-unknown`, `deleting` → its previous state), so a Worker that stopped mid-step does not block the submission. Before `addPullRequestReview`, a pending review of the viewer returns `409 PENDING_REVIEW_EXISTS` without the mutation and closes the record. When the outcome report itself fails after a mutation, the client receives `502 UPSTREAM_FAILURE` and resolves it with `pullRequestReviewContext`.

### Responses

Success is `200` JSON with only these fields; upstream headers are dropped and responses are `no-store`. An upstream body over the limit, not JSON, or of another shape returns `502 UPSTREAM_FAILURE`.

| Route | Upstream limit | Fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /pulls` | 1 MiB | array of `number, title, state, draft, merged_at, updated_at, user.login, head{sha, ref}, base{sha, ref}` |
| `GET /pulls/<n>` | 1 MiB | `number, title, state, draft, merged_at, user.login, body` (when GitHub sends it), `body_text, changed_files, head{sha, ref, repo.full_name}, base{sha, ref, repo.full_name}` |
| `GET /pulls/<n>/reviews` | 4 MiB | array of `id, user.login, commit_id, state, submitted_at, body` |
| `POST /pulls/<n>/reviews` | 1 MiB | `id, state, commit_id, submitted_at, html_url` |
| `pullRequestReviewContext` | 256 KiB | `headRefOid`, `viewer`, `pendingReview` (`null` or `{ours, commitOid, createdAt}`), `reviews` (the viewer's reviews among the last 30, newest first, `{state, commitOid, submittedAt, ours}`), and `submit` (`{state, threads}`) with an ID |
| `addPullRequestReview` | 64 KiB | `{state: "PENDING", commitOid}` |
| `addPullRequestReviewThread` | 64 KiB | `{threads}` |
| `submitPullRequestReview` | 64 KiB | `{state, commitOid, submittedAt, url}` |
| `deletePullRequestReview` | 64 KiB | `{deleted: true}` |

`ours` is true for the review recorded under the request's `Review-Submit-Id`. A null `user`, `head.repo` or commit is returned as `null`.

### Errors and rate limits

Error bodies are `{code, requestId}`, plus `retryAfter` (non-negative integer seconds) for GitHub rate limits: `retry-after`, else `x-ratelimit-reset` minus now, else 60. GitHub's error messages are neither returned nor logged.

| Upstream | Client |
| --- | --- |
| REST `429`, or `403` with `x-ratelimit-remaining: 0` or `retry-after` | `429 RATE_LIMITED` |
| REST `401`/`403` | `403 FORBIDDEN` |
| REST `404` | `404 PULL_REQUEST_NOT_FOUND` on a pull request route; `403 FORBIDDEN` on the list |
| REST `422` on the review POST | `422 REVIEW_REJECTED` |
| GraphQL `200` with `errors[].type` `RATE_LIMITED`, or with errors (or no data) and `x-ratelimit-remaining: 0`; GraphQL `429`, or `403` with a rate-limit header | `429 RATE_LIMITED` (not sent) |
| GraphQL `401`/`403`, or `errors[].type` `FORBIDDEN` | `403 FORBIDDEN` (not sent) |
| GraphQL `NOT_FOUND` | the check and `addPullRequestReview`: `404 PULL_REQUEST_NOT_FOUND` in the verified repository, otherwise `403 FORBIDDEN`; thread and submit: `409 REVIEW_STEP_CONFLICT` (record closed); delete: success |
| GraphQL `200` with `data: null` and other errors | `422 REVIEW_THREAD_REJECTED` for a thread, otherwise `422 REVIEW_REJECTED` (not sent) |
| GraphQL `data` with errors, a mismatched shape, `502`, a lost connection | `502 UPSTREAM_FAILURE` (outcome unknown) |
| `504` or the 30-second timeout | `504 UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT` (outcome unknown) |
| Other statuses | `502 UPSTREAM_FAILURE` (not sent) |

A well-formed successful GraphQL `200` is success even when `x-ratelimit-remaining` is `0`, because that request consumed the last point. The routes log nothing: no request body, `path`, `Authorization`, upstream body or node ID.

## Enable and roll back

Configure `GIT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and the exact HTTPS `GIT_PROXY_ORIGIN` in both Workers. In the BFF, configure `GIT_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GIT_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GIT_GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI` ending in `/v1/git-auth/callback`, and `GIT_SESSION_KEY` as a secret with 32 random bytes encoded as 64 hex digits. Register `GitSession` as a SQLite-backed Durable Object in the BFF. Bind it as `GIT_SESSIONS` in the BFF and in the Git Worker, where the binding names the BFF script. These bindings are optional and the dedicated routes fail closed when they are absent.

[github-app-setup.md](./github-app-setup.md) explains how to create the GitHub App that provides `GIT_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GIT_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.

Set `GIT_GITHUB_API` in the Git Worker to enable the GitHub API routes, for example `pulls-read,review-threads,reviews-body`. The GitHub App also needs the repository permission Pull requests: Read and write, approved by each installation. `review` is a new field of the existing `GitSession` storage record and `review-ids` and `review-submits` are new keys, so no Durable Object migration is needed.

Roll back by removing the Git routes' bindings and revoking the affected session records. The existing BFF login routes and generic CORS proxy keep their own configuration. Removing `review-threads` from `GIT_GITHUB_API` stops only the GraphQL routes, so a client falls back to the review body routes when `reviews-body` remains; removing the variable stops every GitHub API route. The Git routes, login and session records are unaffected. `review-ids` and `review-submits` expire with the login. A pending review left on GitHub during a rollback stays private to its author, who can discard it on the pull request page.
